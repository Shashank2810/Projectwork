Box Shooter Game
Welcome to the Box Shooter game! This README will explain what the game is about and how it works, even if you're not familiar with programming.

Overview
In this game, you control a white box (representing the player) using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. The objective is to shoot down red boxes falling from the top of the screen before they reach the bottom. Each red box you shoot gives you points.

How to Play
Controls:

Use the left arrow key to move the player box to the left.
Use the right arrow key to move the player box to the right.
Press the spacebar to shoot bullets upwards from the player box.


Objective:

Your goal is to shoot the red boxes (enemies) falling from the top of the screen.
Try to shoot as many red boxes as possible to earn points.


Game Over:

The game ends if a red box reaches the bottom of the screen or if the player box collides with any of the falling red boxes.
After the game ends, your final score will be displayed.


Why This Code?
This game is programmed using Python with a library called Pygame, which is popular for making 2D games. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

Player Class (Player):
Represents the white box controlled by the player.
Moves left and right based on keyboard input.


Enemy Class (Huddle):
Represents the falling red boxes (enemies).
Randomly appears at the top of the screen and moves downward.
If it reaches the bottom without being shot, the game ends.

Bullet Class (Bullet):
Represents the bullets shot by the player.
Moves upward when fired and disappears if it reaches the top of the screen.

Game Loop:
Controls the flow of the game.
Updates the game state, checks for collisions, and redraws the screen continuously.

Sound Effects:
Adds shooting and explosion sounds to enhance the gaming experience.
Sound effects play when the player shoots or hits an enemy.
