Face Recognition and Hand Gesture Control

Overview
This project allows you to use your computer's webcam to recognize specific faces and control the volume using hand gestures.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to automate certain tasks using facial recognition and hand gestures. By recognizing familiar faces, the program can perform actions like announcing the user's name and granting volume control based on hand gestures.

How It Works
Face Recognition
What: Face recognition is a technology that identifies and verifies a person from digital images.
Why: We use face recognition to detect known faces (e.g., family members) captured by the webcam.
How: The program compares faces in real-time with pre-loaded face images to determine if a recognized face is present. When a match is found, it announces the name of the recognized person.


Hand Gesture Control
What: Hand gesture control allows you to manipulate actions on your computer by moving your hands.
Why: We use hand gestures to control the volume on the computer.
How: The program uses the webcam to track hand movements. When a specific hand gesture (like thumbs-up or thumbs-down) is detected, it adjusts the volume accordinglyâ€”up for thumbs-up and down for thumbs-down.

Usage
Install Required Software: Before using the program, make sure to install the necessary software packages mentioned in the requirements section.
Set Up Known Faces: Add images of the faces you want the program to recognize to the faces folder. Ensure the images are clear and properly named.
Run the Program: Execute the script (face_hand_control.py) to start the face recognition and hand gesture control.
Interact with the Program: Sit in front of the webcam. When the program recognizes your face, it will announce your name. Use hand gestures (thumbs-up or thumbs-down) to control the volume on your computer.
