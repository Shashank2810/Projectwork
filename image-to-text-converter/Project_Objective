Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that can detect image tampering or alterations by comparing an original image with a potentially tampered version. The application will provide users with a simple and efficient tool to assess the integrity of digital images, which is crucial for various industries where image authenticity is paramount.
Background:
In today's digital age, the authenticity and integrity of images are vital for businesses, organizations, and individuals across multiple sectors, including journalism, forensics, e-commerce, and legal documentation. With the widespread use of image editing software, there is an increased risk of malicious tampering or unintentional alterations to digital images, leading to potential misinformation, fraud, or legal disputes.
Scope:
The scope of this project includes:
•	Developing a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload two images: an original image and a potentially tampered image.
•	Implementing an image processing algorithm to compute the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between the uploaded images.
•	Establishing a threshold within the application to determine whether the tampered image significantly deviates from the original based on the computed SSIM score.
•	Providing clear and intuitive feedback to users regarding the tampering status of the uploaded images (i.e., "Tampered" or "Not Tampered").
Features:
The key features of the application include:
•	User-friendly web interface for uploading images and obtaining tampering analysis results.
•	Efficient image processing using Python libraries (PIL, NumPy, OpenCV) to compute SSIM.
•	Real-time feedback on image integrity based on predefined tampering thresholds.
•	Secure handling of uploaded images with temporary storage and deletion post-analysis to ensure data privacy.
Business Goals:
The business goals of developing this application are:
1.	Enhanced Image Integrity: Enable users to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital images efficiently.
2.	Risk Mitigation: Reduce the risk of misinformation, fraud, or legal disputes arising from tampered images.
3.	User Empowerment: Empower users across various industries to make informed decisions based on reliable image analysis.
4.	Technology Showcase: Showcase proficiency in web development, image processing, and data security using Flask and Python libraries.
Success Criteria:
The success of this project will be evaluated based on:
•	User adoption and positive feedback regarding the application's usability and effectiveness.
•	Demonstrated reduction in incidents related to misinformation or disputes caused by tampered images in relevant industries.
•	Recognition of technical competence through successful implementation and deployment of the application.
Future Enhancements:
Potential future enhancements for the application include:
•	Integration with cloud-based storage services for seamless image upload and analysis.
•	Implementation of machine learning models for more advanced tampering detection.
•	Expansion of features to support batch processing and analysis of multiple images simultaneously.

Timeline and Milestones:
The project will follow a phased approach with the following milestones:
•	Phase 1 (Development): Implement core functionality and user interface (4 weeks).
•	Phase 2 (Testing): Conduct comprehensive testing and debugging (2 weeks).
•	Phase 3 (Deployment): Deploy the application to a production environment (1 week).
•	Phase 4 (Feedback and Iteration): Gather user feedback and iterate based on suggestions (ongoing).
Constraints:
The project will adhere to the following constraints:
•	Use of open-source libraries and technologies to ensure scalability and maintainability.
•	Compliance with data privacy regulations and best practices for handling user-uploaded content.
